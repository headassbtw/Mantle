## Mantle

## [here](https://github.com/headassbtw/COREtool/blob/main/research.md) is a file with the info i've been researching so far

## Why?
Killzone 2 does mesh skinning on the PS3's SPUs, meaning I can't get the unmodified models. This is also a problem because I can't seem to rip the mesh in renderdoc either.

That brings us here, me being way out of my depth just so I can rip some models.

## When?
There's no set timeframe as to when I'll be done. I'm making decent progress however I have a severe motivation problem, as well as school to worry about, then let's just say my plans for after school aren't going to give me much time.
Contributions are welcome, just try to keep them in the general style of my own work.

## Why is there macOS support?
I believe that mental illness should not affect your ability to rip models.
